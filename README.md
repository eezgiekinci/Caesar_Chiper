# Caesar_Chiper

Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique and one of the simplest and most well-known methods of encryption. This encryption method was used by Julius Caesar around 100 B.C. and is named after him.

How Caesar Cipher Works:
Caesar Cipher encrypts by shifting each letter by a certain number of positions. For example, if a letter is located at a certain position in the alphabet, this letter is shifted forward or backward by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

Example:
Let's say the shift value is 3. In this case:

* The letter "A" becomes "D".
* The letter "B" becomes "E".
* The letter "C" becomes "F".
* And so on.
  
In this way, the word "HELLO" shifted by 3 units would be encrypted as "KHOOR".
